I write about stuff I care about: public service, management consulting, and business. 
*Informed* opinion supported by facts where possible. I try and discuss gray areas 
with nuance and sensitivity. I won't always succeed.

If you're interested in my qualifications, look around.  I've been here a while and am 
not hard to find.

Contact information, including the social media I use, can be found in the footer of 
this site. 

I can be bought to speak or tell stories about any topic I write about. If any of this 
piques your interest, contact me. 

Please enjoy.
