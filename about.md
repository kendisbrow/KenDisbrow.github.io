I always find these types pages are some variation on "I'm unique and  great!" or 
"Look at how qualified I am!" 

I write about stuff I care about, public service, tech, and business.  No filters, 
just *informed* opinion. I do know what I don't know. I don't write about that. Arogant 
I know but, I'm qualified to write about the topics here. 

If you're really interested in me or my qualifications, look around.  Not hard to find.

Contact information (Including the social media I use) can be found in the footer of 
these pages. 

I can be bought to speak or tell stories about any of the topics here.  Find me and 
let's talk.  Not being rude but if my style turns you off don't bother - it likely
 wouldn't be of value for either of us. I am about providing value. If I pique your 
 interest, please contact me. I, mostly, don't bite.
