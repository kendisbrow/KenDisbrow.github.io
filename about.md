I write about stuff I care about: public service, tech, and business. *Informed* opinion
supported by facts where possible. I generally know what I don't know. I don't write 
about those topics. Arogant I know but, I'm only qualified to write about the topics here. 

If you're interested in my qualifications, look around.  I've been here a while and am 
not hard to find.

Contact information, including the social media I use, can be found in the footer of 
this site. 

I can be bought to speak or tell stories about any of the topics here. If any of this 
piques your interest, please contact me.
